# Resiliencia Podcast
This is currently in its first iteration. A working subcribe to our newsletter page of my co-founded **Podcast**
We talk about entrepreneurship, motivation, studies and other issues surrounding the aspiring youth in Angola.. Our aim is to gain the angolan diaspora's attention, create a blog and transcribe our best podcasts to also have readers audience.
